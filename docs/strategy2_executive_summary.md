# Strategy 2 - Dual Context Adapter: Executive Summary

## Bottom Line: DO NOT IMPLEMENT

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Architectural incompatibility with patch-based training
**Benefit Estimate**: +0-2% quality improvement (uncertain)
**Cost Estimate**: 10x memory increase, 67% latency overhead, 2-3 weeks development

---

## Critical Blockers

### 1. Training Paradigm Incompatibility (FATAL)

**Current training**: Network sees random **256x256 crops** from different images
- Batch composition: `[8, 7, 256, 256]` - individual crops from 8 random patches
- No access to full 1080x1920 images
- No image-level context available

**Global context encoder requires**: Full-resolution input **before** patch extraction
- Must process `[1, 7, 1080, 1920]` → `[1, 64, 135, 240]` global features
- Incompatible with current patch extraction pipeline
- Would require **complete rewrite** of training data flow

**Verdict**: Cannot train dual-encoder architecture with current patch-based dataset

---

### 2. Memory Explosion (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER)

| Metric | Current | With Dual Context | Impact |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| GPU Memory (training) | 90MB | 882MB | **+879%** |
| GPU Memory (inference) | 45MB | 495MB | **+1000%** |
| Inference Latency | <3ms | ~5ms | **+67%** |

**Ultra-safe mode broken**: Current config allows 4GB max, dual context needs 792MB per batch
**Mobile deployment at risk**: Latency increase threatens <8ms target (60→120fps requirement)

---

### 3. Redundant Functionality (WASTED EFFORT)

**Existing architecture already has global context modeling**:

```python
# src/npu/networks/patch/lightweight_attention.py
class LightweightSelfAttention:
    """
    - HierarchicalSpatialAttention: Multi-scale global dependencies
    - SeparableAttention2D: Long-range spatial relationships
    - PositionalEncoding2D: Spatial awareness
    Parameters: ~32K, Complexity: O(N)
    """
```

**Dual Context Adapter provides**:
- 3-layer encoder: 43K params, 792MB activations
- Single-scale fusion at decoder output
- **O(N²) complexity** (interpolation at multiple resolutions)

**Comparison**: Existing attention is **more efficient**, **better integrated**, and **already proven** (80 epochs trained)

---

### 4. Architectural Design Flaws

**Insufficient semantic capacity**:
- Proposed: 64 channels at /8 resolution
- Industry standard: 256-512 channels (ResNet50, DeepLabV3)
- **Too shallow** to capture scene semantics (geometry, lighting, materials)

**Single-scale fusion**:
- Proposed: Fuse context only at final decoder output
- Modern architectures: Multi-scale fusion (FPN, U-Net++, MAT)
- **Missing** early-stage detail guidance and mid-stage structural hints

**Outdated approach**:
- Dual-encoder popular in 2018-2020 (EdgeConnect, Partial Conv)
- Modern methods (2023-2024): Unified architectures (Transformers, FFT)
- LaMa, MAT, CoModGAN all avoid separate global encoders

---

## Implementation Challenges (If Forced)

### Required Code Changes

1. **PatchNetwork signature**: Add `context_feat` parameter to `forward()`
2. **Skip connection fusion**: Modify all 4 decoder layers to concat context
3. **Channel dimensions**: Increase `up_conv1-4` input channels by 64 (+30% params)
4. **Data pipeline**: Rewrite to process full images before patch extraction
5. **Training loop**: Maintain image-to-patches mapping across batches

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 weeks development + 2-3 weeks debugging + full retraining

### Technical Debt Created

- **Dual forward modes**: Patch-based (training) vs full-image (inference)
- **Complex state management**: Global context caching, coordinate mapping
- **Testing burden**: Must validate both training and inference paths
- **Maintenance overhead**: More complex architecture, harder to debug

---

## Recommended Alternatives

### Option A: Do Nothing (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Current architecture strengths**:
- ✅ 5-layer U-Net with edge-aligned boundary detection
- ✅ LightweightSelfAttention for global modeling (32K params)
- ✅ Proven training stability (80/200 epochs, val_loss=8.25)
- ✅ On track for <3ms mobile NPU target

**Next priorities**:
1. Complete training to 200 epochs
2. Experiment with `base_channels=64` (higher capacity)
3. Validate on test set and real-world data
4. **GPU Warp C++ implementation** (critical path)

### Option B: Enhance Existing Attention

**If more capacity needed**:
```python
class EnhancedLightweightAttention:
    # Add deformable attention (adaptive receptive field)
    self.deformable = DeformableAttention(channels, n_points=8)
    # Add cross-scale attention
    self.cross_scale = CrossScaleAttention(channels)
```

**Benefits**: <100K params, no training paradigm change, proven techniques from DETR

### Option C: Multi-Scale Patch Processing

**Process patches at multiple resolutions**:
- Fine network: 256x256 patches (detail)
- Coarse network: 512x512 patches (context)
- Fusion: Combine predictions

**Benefits**: Larger context window, still patch-based, flexible deployment

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs (Certain)
- ⛔ 10x GPU memory → requires datacenter GPUs
- ⛔ 67% latency increase → may miss mobile target
- ⛔ 2-3 weeks dev time → delays critical GPU Warp work
- ⛔ High technical debt → complex architecture
- ⛔ Training from scratch → current 80-epoch progress lost

### Benefits (Uncertain)
- ❓ Quality: +0-2% SSIM (optimistic: +5%, realistic: +1%, pessimistic: negative)
- ❓ Robustness: Unclear if global context helps motion-vector-guided inpainting
- ❓ Academic completeness: "We tried global context" (minor research value)

**ROI**: **Strongly negative** - High costs, minimal uncertain benefits

## Quality Impact Analysis

### When Global Context Helps (Rare)

**Large semantic holes** (>100x100 pixels):
- Requires scene understanding (sky vs building boundary)
- **BUT**: Current system targets <8ms latency → large holes indicate forward projection failure
- **AND**: Motion vectors already provide boundary hints

### When Global Context Doesn't Help (Common)

**Small texture holes** (<50x50 pixels):
- Local context (256x256 patch) contains 26x more information than hole
- Texture synthesis works well locally
- Global scene layout irrelevant

**Disoccluded regions** (new background):
- Fundamental extrapolation problem
- Global context can't create information that doesn't exist
- Motion vectors are critical, not global semantics

### Empirical Evidence

**Patch-based methods** (PatchMatch, Coherency):
- Work well **without** global context
- Rely on local texture similarity

**Modern deep learning** (LaMa, MAT):
- Use **implicit** global modeling (FFT, attention windows)
- Avoid explicit dual-encoder designs

**Current architecture**:
- Receptive field: ~255x255 (covers entire patch)
- Attention mechanism: Already captures long-range dependencies
- **Likely sufficient** for motion-vector-guided hole filling

---

## Final Verdict

### DO NOT IMPLEMENT

**Architectural incompatibility**: Patch-based training cannot leverage global context
**Memory explosion**: 10x increase breaks deployment constraints
**Redundant functionality**: Existing attention already provides global modeling
**Uncertain benefit**: 0-2% quality improvement (if any)
**High risk**: Training instability, technical debt, wasted effort

### Recommended Path Forward

**Focus on critical priorities**:
1. ✅ Complete current training (120 epochs remaining)
2. ✅ GPU Warp C++ implementation (enables end-to-end pipeline)
3. ✅ Mobile deployment and latency validation
4. ✅ Real-world testing and iteration

**If quality insufficient** (only after Phase 1-3):
- Try `base_channels=64` (2.67x capacity increase)
- Enhance existing attention (deformable, cross-scale)
- Multi-scale patch processing

**Do NOT pursue**:
- ⛔ Dual Context Adapter
- ⛔ Separate global encoder
- ⛔ Any approach requiring full-image training
